## Debugging and Best Practices
### 1. Common debugging tips(docker logs, docker exec)

To go inside the running container
```
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash
```
To run command inside the container from outside the container. The command runs in the default working directory of conatiner
```
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash -c "ls"
```

To check the container logs
```
docker logs CONTAINER_ID
```
### 2. Keeping images lightweight
#### 2.1 Using lightweight docker image is essential for:
- Faster build and deployment.
- Consume fewer system resources (CPU, memory, and disk I/O).
- Less data transfer is required when pulling images, reducing network costs.
- Easier to update and maintain over time. Smaller images contain fewer dependencies, reducing conflicts and complexity.

#### 2.2 To keep images lightweight, follow the following practices:
- Use Minimal Base Images
- Use Multi-Stage Builds
- Avoid Installing Unnecessary Packages using
  ```
  apt install --no-install-recommends package_name
  ```
  It makes sure only the main dependencies for the package are installed.
- Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files like logs, .git
  ```
  .git
  __pycache__
  node_modules
  *.log
  ```
- Minimize Layers & Clean Up
  Instead of creating multiple layers. Use a single-line command.

  ```
  RUN apt-get update -y
  RUN apt-get upgrade -y
  RUN apt-get install vim -y
  RUN apt-get install net-tools -y
  RUN apt-get install dnsutils -y
  ```
  
  ```
  RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get install --no-install-recommends vim net-tools dnsutils -y
  ```
- Keep Application Data Elsewhere
  Storing application data in the image will unnecessarily increase the size of the images. Itâ€™s highly recommended to use the volume feature of the container runtimes to      keep the image separate from the data.
