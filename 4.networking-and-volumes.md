# 1. Exposing ports for external access

## 1.1 Using Docker CLI

HOST_PORT: The port number on your host machine where you want to receive traffic
CONTAINER_PORT: The port number within the container that's listening for connections

### 1.1.1. Publish specific container port to specific host port
```
docker run -d -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT docker_image
```

### 1.1.2. Publish specific container port to any host port available
Just publish the port and don’t care which host port is used. In these cases, you can let Docker pick the port for you. To do so, simply omit the HOST_PORT configuration.

```
docker run -d -p CONTAINER_PORT docker_image
```
### 1.1.3. Publish all ports
With the -P or --publish-all flag, you can automatically publish all exposed ports to ephemeral ports.

```
docker run -P docker_image
```

## 1.2 Using docker compose

```
services:
  app:
    image: docker/welcome-to-docker
    ports:
      - 8080:80
```
The ports configuration accepts a few different forms of syntax for the port definition. In this case, we’re using the same HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT used in the docker run command.

## 2. Adding volumes for persistent data storage
All files created inside a container are stored on a writable container layer that sits on top of the read-only, immutable image layers.

Data written to the container layer doesn't persist when the container is destroyed. This means that it can be difficult to get the data out of the container if another process needs it.

### 2.1 Bind mounts vs. Docker volumes

Bind mounts create a direct link between a host system path and a container, allowing access to files or directories stored anywhere on the host. Since they aren't isolated by Docker, both non-Docker processes on the host and container processes can modify the mounted files simultaneously. Use bind mounts when you need to be able to access files from both the container and the host.

Volumes are persistent storage mechanisms managed by the Docker daemon. They retain data even after the containers using them are removed. Volume data is stored on the filesystem on the host, but to interact with the data in the volume, you must mount the volume to a container. Volumes are ideal for performance-critical data processing and long-term storage needs. Since the storage location is managed on the daemon host, volumes provide the same raw file performance as accessing the host filesystem directly.
