## 1. What is Docker and why use it?
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
## 2. Key concepts:
### 2.1 Images
An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.

You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.
### 2.2 Containers
A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.

By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine. You can control how isolated a container's network, storage, or other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host machine.

A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that aren't stored in persistent storage disappear.
### 2.3 Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
The Dockerfile supports the following instructions:

- ADD	Add local or remote files and directories.
- ARG	Use build-time variables.
- CMD	Specify default commands.
- COPY	Copy files and directories.
- ENTRYPOINT	Specify default executable.
- ENV	Set environment variables.
- EXPOSE	Describe which ports your application is listening on.
- FROM	Create a new build stage from a base image.
- HEALTHCHECK	Check a container's health on startup.
- LABEL	Add metadata to an image.
- MAINTAINER	Specify the author of an image.
- ONBUILD	Specify instructions for when the image is used in a build.
- RUN	Execute build commands.
- SHELL	Set the default shell of an image.
- STOPSIGNAL	Specify the system call signal for exiting a container.
- USER	Set user and group ID.
- VOLUME	Create volume mounts.
- WORKDIR	Change working directory.

### 2.4 Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.

Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.

Compose works in all environments; production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

- Start, stop, and rebuild services
- View the status of running services
- Stream the log output of running services
- Run a one-off command on a service
