## Dockerizing a sample web application
### 1. Sample Web Application
### 2. Writing a Dockerfile
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

#### 2.1 Choosing a base image
  We are building a Python application and choosing Python as the base image.
  To search for the base image, follow the following steps:
  - Go to https://hub.docker.com/.
  - Search for python. Select Images.
  - Select "python".
  - Select "Tags" from taglist.
  - Choose the version you are looking for that is lightweight and has less vulnerabilities.
     

#### 2.2 Installing dependencies
Install dependencies using RUN command.
```
RUN apt update && apt install -y curl vim
```
```
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2.3 Setting up the working directory
The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile. If the WORKDIR doesn't exist, it will be created even if it's not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.

```
WORKDIR /app
```

#### 2.4 Copying files and running the application
The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path <dest>
```
COPY .  .
```

The CMD instruction sets the command to be executed when running a container from an image.
```
MD ["python", "run.py"]
```

### 3. Building the Docker Image
```
sudo docker compose up -d

```
### 4. Running the container
```
$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES

```

```
$ curl localhost:5000
{"message":"Welcome to the Dockerized Flask App with PostgreSQL!"}

```
