## Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.
### 1. Why Docker Compose
Using Docker Compose offers several benefits that streamline the development, deployment, and management of containerized applications:

Simplified control: Docker Compose allows you to define and manage multi-container applications in a single YAML file. This simplifies the complex task of orchestrating and coordinating various services, making it easier to manage and replicate your application environment.

Efficient collaboration: Docker Compose configuration files are easy to share, facilitating collaboration among developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders. This collaborative approach leads to smoother workflows, faster issue resolution, and increased overall efficiency.

Rapid application development: Compose caches the configuration used to create a container. When you restart a service that has not changed, Compose re-uses the existing containers. Re-using containers means that you can make changes to your environment very quickly.

Portability across environments: Compose supports variables in the Compose file. You can use these variables to customize your composition for different environments, or different users.

Extensive community and support: Docker Compose benefits from a vibrant and active community, which means abundant resources, tutorials, and support. This community-driven ecosystem contributes to the continuous improvement of Docker Compose and helps users troubleshoot issues effectively.
### 2. Writing a docker-compose.yml file
#### 2.1 Defining services(e.g. web app, database)

```
  web:
    build: app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://user:password@db:5432/workshop_db
    depends_on:
      - db
```
```
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: workshop_db
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

- Services:
web: Represents the Flask application. The build key specifies the Dockerfile for the app.
db: Uses the official PostgreSQL image with environment variables for configuration.

- Environment Variables:
DATABASE_URL: This connects the Flask app to the PostgreSQL database. It uses the format postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DBNAME.

- Ports:
Flask (5000:5000): Maps port 5000 on the host to port 5000 in the container.
PostgreSQL (5432:5432): Makes the database accessible on the default port.

- Volumes:
db_data: Ensures the PostgreSQL data persists even if the container is stopped.

#### 2.2 Managing multiple containers

```
services:
  web:
    build: app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://user:password@db:5432/workshop_db
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: workshop_db
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```
### 3. Running the application stack with docker-compose up

```
sudo docker compose up -d
```
